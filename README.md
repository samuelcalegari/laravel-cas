# Apereo CAS Authentication for Laravel

Easy Bring to CAS Authentication for Laravel 9 and Apereo PhpCAS 1.6

Fork from https://github.com/sentrasoft/laravel-cas

## Install


#### Via Composer

``` php
$ composer require samuelcalegari/laravel-cas:@dev
```

#### Via edit `composer.json`

	"require": {
	...
        "samuelcalegari/laravel-cas": "@dev"
    },

Next, update Composer from the Terminal:

``` bash
$ composer update
```

## Configuration

After updating composer, add the ServiceProvider to the providers array in `config/app.php`.

```php
'providers' => array(
    .....
    Sentrasoft\Cas\CasServiceProvider::class,
);
```

Now add the alias in `config/app.php`.

```php
'aliases' => array(
    ......
    'Cas' => Sentrasoft\Cas\Facades\Cas::class,
);
```

Add the middelware to your `Kernel.php` file or leverage your own:
```php
'cas.auth'  => \Sentrasoft\Cas\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
'cas.guest' => \Sentrasoft\Cas\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated::class,
```

Now publish the configuration `cas.php` file:
``` php
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Sentrasoft\Cas\CasServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

Add new environment variables below to your `.env`
```
CAS_HOSTNAME=cas.example.com
CAS_VALIDATION=https://cas.example.com/cas/p3/serviceValidate
CAS_VERSION=3.0
CAS_CONTROL_SESSIONS=true
CAS_LOGOUT_URL=https://cas.example.com/cas/logout
CAS_SERVICE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

> To see further configuration, please see and read the description for each configuration item [config/cas.php](src/Config/cas.php)

## Route

#### Authentication
Redirect the user to the authentication page for the provider.
```php
Route::get('/cas/login', function() {
    return cas()->authenticate();
})->name('cas.login');
```

#### Controller and Callback Route
You can create a new controller named `Auth\CasController`.
```php
php artisan make:controller Auth\CasController
```

```php
class CasController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Obtain the user information from CAS.
     *
     * @return Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse
     */
    public function callback()
    {
        // $username = Cas::getUser();
        // Here you can store the returned information in a local User model on your database (or storage).

        // This is particularly usefull in case of profile construction with roles and other details
        // e.g. Auth::login($local_user);

        return redirect()->route('home');
    }
}
```

When the authentication is performed the callback url is invoked. In that callback you can process the User and create a local entry in the database.
```php
Route::get('/cas/callback', 'Auth\CasController@callback')->name('cas.callback');
```

#### Logout
Logout of the CAS Session and redirect users.

```php
Route::post('/cas/logout', [ 'middleware' => 'cas.auth', function() {
    cas()->logout();

    // You can also add @param string $url in param[0]
    cas()->logout(url('/'));

    // Or add @param string $service in param[1]
    cas()->logout('', url('/'));

}])->name('cas.logout');
```

>The `cas.auth` middleware is optional, but you will need to handle the error when a user tries to logout when they do not have a CAS Session.

> If the `CAS_LOGOUT_REDIRECT` configuration item in `.env` is added, the value is taken from that configuration. Or if nothing is configured, the value is taken based on the value you specified.


If you want to use *SLO (Single Logout)* (if the CAS server supports SLO), Your application must have a valid SSL and the CAS server must be able to send *HTTP POST* `/cas/logout` without having to verify `CsrfToken`. Therefore, you must change the `App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken` file and exclude `/cas/logout` route.

```php
/**
 * The URIs that should be excluded from CSRF verification.
 *
 * @var array
 */
protected $except = [
    //

    '/cas/logout',
];
```

You can check that it works by trying to send an *HTTP POST* via [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL).
```
curl -X POST https://yourapp.com/cas/logout
```

## Usage

#### Get User
To retrieve authenticated credentials.

> Not ID (integer), but given on the CAS login (username) form.

```php
$uid = Cas::user()->id;
```

#### Get User Attributes
Get the attributes for for the currently connected user.
```php
foreach (Cas::user()->getAttributes() as $key => $value) {
	...
}
```

#### Get User Attribute
Retrieve a specific attribute by key name. The attribute returned can be either a string or an array based on matches.
```php
$value = Cas::user()->getAttribute('key');
```
